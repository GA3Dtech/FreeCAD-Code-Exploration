As a developer, we all start with experience, so in a nutshell, that's where I'm starting from. Generally speaking, I like to go back to the roots of all concepts to master them better.
## user experience

I've been a FreeCAD user for about 10 years. At first out of curiosity, then for DIY hobbies, then bigger DIY projects (multifunctional 3D printers like this [GA3D M2](https://github.com/GA3Dtech/GA3D-basicbot-2023) or this [SAK-Bot](https://github.com/GA3Dtech/SAK-Bot) ). For the last 6 years, I've been using FreeCAD successfully as a CAD specialist in a small precision mechanics company manufacturing small machines. 

In the past I started learning CAD with Solidworks and CATIA software.

Today, I feel able to model almost anything with FreeCAD. Only very large assemblies with several thousand parts seem to me to be still difficult to do with FreeCAD.

## Coder Experience

I'm an engineer who learned to code in C and C++ during my studies (22 years ago). git didn't exist yet ... the last 6 years I've coded mainly in python for computer vision applications with graphical interfaces. I'm comfortable on Linux.
