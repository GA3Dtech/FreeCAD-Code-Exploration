## Why

to learn, to understand
##### to developp (aims)

###### Own workbenches ideas
- Retroengineering WB to rebuild old parts, or broken parts (positionninon on SAK-bot + cheap kids mircroscope + backlight) => scaling, edges, radius, + shapes detection and conversion to sketches.
- 3D printing useful customized tools :
	- Polymeshing surfaces
	- quick stiffners addition
	- support addition
	- ...

##### to improve customize
-  big assembly management with an import tool in mesh + a few functionnal surfaces for constraint + possibility of reedition to change, add, or remove functional surfaces.

##### to solve discovered and blocking issues

- to document and understand what is going on 



## About me

As a developer, we all start with a given experience and initial formation, so in a nutshell, that's where I'm starting from. Generally speaking, I like to go back to the roots of all concepts to master them better.
## user experience

I've been a FreeCAD user for about 10 years. At first out of curiosity, then for DIY hobbies, then bigger DIY projects (multifunctional 3D printers like this [GA3D M2](https://github.com/GA3Dtech/GA3D-basicbot-2023) or this [SAK-Bot](https://github.com/GA3Dtech/SAK-Bot) ). For the last 6 years, I've been using FreeCAD successfully as a CAD specialist in a small precision mechanics company manufacturing small machines. 

In the past I started learning CAD with Solidworks and CATIA software.

Today, I feel able to model almost anything with FreeCAD. Only very large assemblies with several thousand parts seem to me to be still difficult to do with FreeCAD.

## Coder Experience

I'm an engineer who learned to code in C and C++ during my studies (22 years ago). git didn't exist yet ... the last 6 years I've coded mainly in python for computer vision applications with graphical interfaces. I'm comfortable on Linux.
